summary: '"Dragon Moon" by Henry Kuttner is a novelette of lost Atlantis written during
  the early 20th century. The story follows Elak, a descendant of the royal line of
  Cyrena, as he battles the malevolent entity known as Karkora, the Pallid One, who
  has possessed Sepher, the king of Kiriath. Delving into themes of magic, ancient
  legends, and personal destiny, the narrative weaves together adventure and the supernatural
  against a richly imagined backdrop of Atlantis.  In the tale, Elak faces numerous
  challenges as he discovers the truth about Karkora and the fate of his family. After
  a tumultuous journey that leads him to encounter allies, including Aynger of Amenalk
  and Mayana, a sea-witch, he learns that Karkora is an abomination created from the
  dark sorcery of Erykion. Armed with newfound strength and a magical talisman, Elak
  ultimately confronts Karkora and Sepher in a climactic battle for the fate of Cyrena.
  With themes of sacrifice and the struggle against malevolent forces, Kuttner crafts
  a gripping narrative that showcases the hero''s journey in a world where magic reigns
  and ancient evils lurk. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
